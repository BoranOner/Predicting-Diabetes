# Predicting-Diabetes

In this project diabetes prediction was made using the following machine learning algorithms;
Gaussian Naive Bayes, 
Bernoulli Naive Bayes, 
Logistic Regression, 
Decision Tree, 
Support Vector Machine, 
K-Nearest Neighbor, 
Multilayer Perceptron, 
Random Forest, 
Gradient Boosting, 
Xg Boost, 

Point of this project is to see which machine learning algorithm gives better results for the Diabetes Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
